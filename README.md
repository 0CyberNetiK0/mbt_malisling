### Dependencies:
* [ox_inventory](https://github.com/overextended/ox_inventory)
* [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib)

### ⚠️Important:
The resource has been tested ONLY on Ox Core and ESX\
In order to allow the holster feature to work, the functions
```Weapon.Disarm``` and ```Weapon.Equip``` have been slightly edited and appended after the existing ones\
Don't know if it was the best option, but its the one popped up in my head\
This also means that any update of ```ox_inventory``` that invoves them, can break the script behavior
